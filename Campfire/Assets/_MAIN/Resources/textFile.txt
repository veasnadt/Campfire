"Phone is ringing..."

You "Veronica Rivas, private investigator. {wa 3} How can I help you?"

Caller "H-hello? I need someone to find my daughter. {c} She hasn’t been answering my calls but the police say the property looks fine and they’re not going to investigate further. {c} They say she’s not there, but I know she’d tell me if she decided to travel. {c} Could you please go out to [REDACTED] and find out what happened?"

"You and your partner, Herschel Simmons, go out to the cabin and decide to set up their tent since it's a large area and they expect it to take a while."

Herschel "I can’t believe how far out this is. Who the hell would want to live here?"

You "The path up here’s not even accessible to cars. How does she get around?"

Herschel "She can’t make that walk down to the road every day, so maybe something went wrong with her phone lines and she hasn’t bothered to fix it yet."

You "But the police said they didn’t find anyone at the cabin. No one knows where she is."

Herschel "This property is bigger than I expected. It'll take a long time to search the woods."

You "Guess we should set up camp, like I suggested on the way up. We’re miles away from the closest neighbors and I sure as hell am not walking down that hill in the dark."

Herschel "Fine, do what you want."

"You and Herschel begin to set up camp."

You "We should start searching before it gets too late."

Hershel "Should we check the cabin or the surrounding property first?"

"Go inside the cabin or further investigate outside?"
